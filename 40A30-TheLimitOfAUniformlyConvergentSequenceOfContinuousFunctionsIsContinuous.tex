{\bf Theorem.} The limit of a uniformly convergent sequence of continuous functions is continuous. 

\emph{Proof.} Let $f_n,f:X\rightarrow Y$, where $(X,\rho)$ and $(Y,d)$ are metric spaces. Suppose $f_n \rightarrow f$ uniformly and each $f_n$ is continuous. Then given any $\epsilon>0$, there exists $N$ such that $n>N$ implies $d(f(x),f_{n}(x)) < \frac{\epsilon}{3}$ for all $x$. Pick an arbitrary $n$ larger than $N$. Since $f_n$ is continuous, given any point $x_0$, there exists $\delta>0$ such that $0<\rho(x,x_0)<\delta$ implies $d(f_n(x), f_n(x_0))<\frac{\epsilon}{3}$. Therefore, given any $x_0$ and $\epsilon>0$, there exists $\delta>0$ such that 
\[0<\rho(x,x_0)<\delta\Rightarrow d(f(x),f(x_0)) \leq d(f(x),f_n(x)) + d(f_n(x),f_n(x_0)) + d(f_n(x_0),f(x_0)) < \epsilon.\]
Therefore, $f$ is continuous.

The theorem also generalizes to when $X$ is an arbitrary topological space. To generalize it to $X$ an arbitrary topological space, note that if $d(f_n(x),f(x))< \epsilon/3$ for all $x$, then
$x_0\in f_n^{-1}(B_{\epsilon/3}(f_n(x_0)))\subseteq f^{-1}(B_\epsilon(f(x_0)))$,
so $f^{-1}(B_\epsilon(f(x_0)))$ is a neighbourhood of $x_0$. Here $B_{\epsilon}(y)$ denote the open ball of radius $\epsilon$, centered at $y$.
