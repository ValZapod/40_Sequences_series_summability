\begin{document}
The {\em silver ratio} is the sum of 1 and the square root of 2, represented by the Greek letter delta with a subscript S. That is, $\delta_S = 1 + \sqrt{2}$, with an approximate value of 2.4142135623730950488 (see A014176 in Sloane's OEIS). Its continued fraction is $$2 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{1}{2 + \ddots}}},$$ which suggests that the Pell numbers $P_n$ can be used as convergents. Similarly, the $n$th power of the silver ratio for $n > 0$ is $P_n\delta_S + P_{n - 1}$.
