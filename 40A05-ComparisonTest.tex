\begin{document}
The series
$$\sum_{i=0}^\infty a_i$$
with real $a_i$ is absolutely convergent if there is a sequence $(b_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ with positive real $b_n$ such that
$$\sum_{i=0}^\infty b_i$$
is \PMlinkescapetext{convergent} and for all sufficiently large $k$ holds $|a_k|\leq b_k$.

Also, the series $\sum a_i$ is divergent if there is a sequence $(b_n)$ with positive real $b_n$, so that $\sum b_i$ is divergent and $a_k\geq b_k$ for all sufficiently large $k$.
