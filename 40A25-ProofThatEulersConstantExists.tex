\begin{thm} The limit
\[\gamma = \lim_{n\to\infty}\left(\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k} - \ln n\right)\]
exists.
\end{thm}

\textbf{Proof. } Let
\[C_n=\frac{1}{1}+\frac{1}{2}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}-\ln n\]
and
\[D_n=C_n-\frac{1}{n}\]
Then
\[C_{n+1}-C_n=\frac{1}{n+1}-\ln\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)\]
and
\[D_{n+1}-D_n=\frac{1}{n}-\ln\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)\]
Now, by considering the Taylor series for $\ln(1+x)$, we see that
\[\frac{1}{n+1}<\ln\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)<\frac{1}{n}\]
and so
\[C_{n+1}-C_n < 0 < D_{n+1}-D_n\]
Thus, the $C_n$ decrease monotonically, while the $D_n$ increase monotonically, since the differences are negative (positive for $D_n$). Further, $D_n<C_n$ and thus $D_1=0$ is a lower bound for $C_n$. Thus the $C_n$ are monotonically decreasing and bounded below, so they must converge.
