%Dear colleagues,
%We are workink on polynomials that were established and published in an 
%applied physics study. We are a group of mathematicians working on it.
%We coul find and demonstrate THE GENERATING FUNCTION
%We ivestigated ta differential equation and found a soltion -in presss-
%For NUMERICAL we registerd a related sequence in the On-Line Encyclopedia of 
%Integer Sequences  A138034 see 
%http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/?
%q=boubaker+&language=english&go=Search
%Now we are focusing on homogenous differential equation and PRIME sequences 
%issued from these polynomials..please contact us directly at 
%managing_office069@yahoo.fr, so that we give you information,  no matter with %physics !!!!
