\begin{document}
If a series $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n$ of real or complex 
numbers is convergent and the limit of its partial sums is $S$,
then $S$ is said to be the {\em sum of the series}.\, This 
circumstance may be denoted by
     $$\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n \;=\; S$$
or equivalently
     $$a_1+a_2+a_3+\ldots \;=\; S.$$
The sum of series has the distributive property
$$c\,(a_1+a_2+a_3+\ldots) \;=\; ca_1+ca_2+ca_3+\ldots$$
with respect to multiplication.\, Nevertheless, one must not 
think that the sum series means an addition of infinitely many 
numbers --- it's only a question of the limit
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}
\underbrace{(a_1+a_2+\ldots+a_n)}_{\textrm{partial sum}}.$$
See also the entry ``manipulating convergent series''!

The sum of the series is equal to the sum of a partial sum and 
the corresponding remainder term.
