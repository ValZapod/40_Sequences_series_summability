\begin{document}
Let $X$ be any set, and let $Y$ be a topological space. 
A sequence $f_1,f_2,\dots$ of functions mapping $X$ to $Y$ is said to be \emph{pointwise convergent} (or simply convergent) to another function $f$, if the sequence $f_n(x)$ converges to $f(x)$ for each $x$ in $X$. This is usually denoted by $f_n\rightarrow f$.
