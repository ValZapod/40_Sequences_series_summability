\begin{document}
Suppose that the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/n$ converged.  Since all the terms are positive,
we could regroup them as we please, in particular, split the series into two series, that of
even terms and that of odd terms:
\[
 \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} {1 \over n} =
 \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} {1 \over 2n} +
 \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} {1 \over 2n-1}
\]
Since $\sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/n = 2 \sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/(2n)$, we would conclude that
\[
 \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} {1 \over 2n} =
 \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} {1 \over 2n-1} .
\]
But $2n-1 < 2n$, hence $1/(2n) < 1/(2n-1)$, so we would also have
\[
 \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} {1 \over 2n} <
 \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} {1 \over 2n-1} ,
\]
which contradicts the previous conclusion.  Thus, the assumption that the
series converged is untenable.
