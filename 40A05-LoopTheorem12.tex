{THE LOOP THEOREM}

MSC 57M35

In the topology of 3-manifolds, {\bf the loop theorem} is generalization of an ansatz discovered by Max Dehn (The Dehn's Lemma), 
who saw that {\em if a continuous map from a 2-disk to a 3-manifold whose restriction to the boundary's disk has no singularities, 
then it exists another embedding whose restriction to the boundary's disk is equal to the boundary's restriction original map}.

The following statement called the Loop Theorem is a version from J. Stalling, but written in W. Jaco's book.

{\em Let $M$ be a three-manifold and let $S$
 be a connected surface in $\partial M $. Let $N\subset \pi_(M)$ be a normal subgroup.
Let  $f \colon D^2\to M $
be a {\bf continuous map} such that $f(\partial D^2)\subset S$
and $[f|\partial D^2]\notin N$.\\
Then there exists an {\bf embedding} 
$g\colon D^2\to M $ such that 
$g(\partial D^2)\subset S$
and 
$[g|\partial D^2]\notin N$},

The proof is a clever construction due to C. Papakyriakopoulos about a sequence (a tower) of covering spaces.
Maybe the best detailed redaction is due to A. Hatcher.
But in general, accordingly to  Jaco's opinion, {\it ''... for anyone unfamiliar with the techniques of 3-manifold-topology and are here to gain a working knowledge  for the study of problems in this area..., there is no better place to start.''}
