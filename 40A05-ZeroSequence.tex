\begin{document}
Let a field $k$ be equipped with a rank one valuation $|.|$.\, A sequence 
\begin{align}
\langle a_1,\,a_2,\,\ldots \rangle
\end{align}
of elements of $k$ is called a \emph{zero sequence} or a \emph{null sequence}, if\, $\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n = 0$\,
in the metric induced by $|.|$.\\

If $k$ together with the metric induced by its valuation $|.|$ is a 
complete ultrametric field, it's clear that its sequence
(1) has a limit (in $k$) as soon as the sequence
$$\langle a_2\!-a_1,\, a_3\!-\!a_2,\,a_4\!-\!a_3,\,\ldots \rangle$$
is a zero sequence.\\

If $k$ is not complete with respect to its valuation $|.|$, its 
\PMlinkname{completion}{Completion} can be made as follows.\, The 
Cauchy sequences (1) form an integral domain $D$ when the 
operations ``$+$'' and ``$\cdot$'' are defined componentwise.\, The 
subset $P$ of $D$ formed by the zero sequences is a 
maximal ideal, whence the quotient ring $D/P$ is a field 
$K$.\, Moreover, $k$ may be isomorphically embedded into $K$ and 
the valuation $|.|$ may be uniquely extended to a valuation of 
$K$.\, The field $K$ then is complete with respect to $|.|$ and $k$ 
is dense in $K$.
