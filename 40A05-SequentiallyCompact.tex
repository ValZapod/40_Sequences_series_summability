A topological space $X$ is \emph{sequentially compact} if every sequence in $X$ has a convergent subsequence.

Every sequentially compact space is countably compact.  Conversely, every first countable countably compact space is sequentially compact.  The ordinal space $W(2\omega_1)$ is sequentially compact but not first countable, since $\omega_1$ has not countable local basis.

Next, compactness and sequential compactness are not compatible.  In other words, neither one implies the other.  Here's an example of a compact space that is not sequentially compact.  Let $X=I^I$, where $I$ is the closed unit interval (with the usual topology), and $X$ is equipped with the product topology.  Then $X$ is compact (since $I$ is, together with Tychonoff theorem).  However, $X$ is not sequentially compact.  To see this, let $f_n:I\to I$ be the function such that for any $r\in I$, $f(r)$ is the $n$-th digit of $r$ in its binary expansion.  But the sequence $f_1,\ldots, f_n,\ldots$ has no convergent subsequences: if $f_{n_1},\ldots, f_{n_k},\ldots$ is a subsequence, let $r\in I$ such that its binary expansion has its $k$-th digit $0$ iff $k$ is odd, and $1$ otherwise.  Then $f_{n_1}(r),\ldots, f_{n_k}(r), \ldots$ is the sequence $0,1,0,1,\ldots$, and is clearly not convergent.  The ordinal space $\Omega_0:=W(\omega_1)$ is an example of a sequentially compact space that is not compact, since the cover $\lbrace W(\alpha)\mid \alpha\in \Omega_0\rbrace$ has no finite subcover.

When $X$ is a metric space, the following are equivalent:
\begin{itemize}
\item
$X$ is sequentially compact.
\item
$X$ is limit point compact.
\item
$X$ is compact.
\item
$X$ is totally bounded and complete.
\end{itemize}
