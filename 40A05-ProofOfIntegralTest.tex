Consider the function (see the definition of floor)
\[
  g(x)=a_{\lfloor x\rfloor}.
\]

Clearly for $x\in [n,n+1)$, being $f$ non increasing we have 
\[
  g(x+1) = a_{n+1} = f(n+1) \le f(x) \le f(n) = a_n = g(x)
\]
hence
\[
   \int_{M}^{+\infty} g(x+1)\, dx =
   \int_{M+1}^{+\infty} g(x)\, dx \le \int_M^{+\infty} f(x) 
   \le \int_M^{+\infty} g(x)\, dx.
\]

Since the integral of $f$ and $g$ on $[M,M+1]$ is finite we notice that $f$ is integrable on $[M,+\infty)$ if and only if $g$ is integrable on $[M,+\infty)$.

On the other hand $g$ is locally constant so
\[
  \int_n^{n+1} g(x)\, dx = \int_n^{n+1} a_n\, dx = a_n
\]
and hence for all $N\in \mathbb Z$ 
\[
  \int_N^{+\infty} g(x) = \sum_{n=N}^\infty a_n
\]
that is $g$ is integrable on $[N,+\infty)$ if and only if $\sum_{n=N}^\infty a_n$ is convergent.

But, again, $\int_M^N g(x)\, dx$ is finite hence $g$ is integrable on $[M,+\infty)$ if and only if $g$ is integrable on $[N,+\infty)$ and also $\sum_{n=0}^N a_n$ is finite so $\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n$ is convergent if and only if $\sum_{n=N}^\infty a_n$ is convergent.
