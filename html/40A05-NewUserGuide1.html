<p class="ltx_p">One important responsibility is to only contribute your own writing,

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">One thing to bear in mind is that while we want our work to be
consistent and correct, it is not expected that you get things perfect
the first time. On the contrary, writing a correct and complete entry
is an iterative process. We caution you against expecting to be
precisely and exhaustively correct on your first (or second, or third)
attempt! You should not be afraid of receiving corrections and
suggestions from others, and in fact you should expect them.</p>

<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Do not expect to retain “ownership” of your entries if you will not
have time to maintain them. There are plenty of people who will be
willing to adopt abandoned entries. If you do not respond to
corrections in a timely fashion, your entries will eventually be
considered to have been abandoned, and they can then be adopted by
someone else

<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Metadata</span> is a word meaning “data about data”. For our
purposes, this means information about the main (LaTeX) content of

type, keywords, and classification.

</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">To make your entry properly fit in with the rest of PlanetMath, it is
important that you understand how to best write its metadata. This is

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">2.1 </span>Naming Your entry</h3>

<div id="S2.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">There are a few entry naming conventions that have evolved so far
which go a long way towards making PlanetMath a cohesive and
consistent resource. Some of these are purely issues of style, but
many have to do with the dynamics of linking between objects. Note that
they also apply to other “concept labels” — synonyms and defines.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Here are the rules for naming your PlanetMath entries:</p>

<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsubsection">2.1.1 </span>Capitalize for indexing</h4>

<div id="S2.SS1.SSS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">It is convention to capitalize your title as you would want it to appear in an index or list. Generally, this means that only proper nouns and adjectives derived from proper nouns are capitalized.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="S2.SS1.SSS2" class="ltx_subsubsection">
<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection">

<div id="S2.SS1.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Do not start entry titles with “the”, “a”, or “an”. Articles add
no useful information to your entry names.</p>

</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<p class="ltx_p">Not only do we not want (for instance) a ton of entries appearing
under ”T/the …” in the encyclopedia’s index, we also do not want
”the” to be hyperlinked in the body of the entries. (The same goes
for other articles.)</p>

<h4 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection">

<div id="S2.SS1.SSS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">For homonyms (ambiguous terms like “algebra”, “domain”, or
“complex”), it often seems appropriate to append a parenthesized
“subject hint”. For example, one might think the smart thing to do
is name an entry “diagonalization (Cantor)” to avoid conflation with
the linear algebra sense of “diagonalization”. However, the way this
should officially be handled is to assign an appropriate subject
classification to your “diagonalization” object.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.SSS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Adding a parenthesized “subject hint” to your title is acceptable
provided the plain title is at least given as a synonym (and the entry
is still properly classified.) You might want to do this with the
encyclopedia index listing in mind (that is, it might be nice to see
“diagonalization (linear algebra)” in the index.)</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">2.2 </span>Classification</h3>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">You had a hint already of one reason why classification is important:
homonyms abound. There are a large number of terms in mathematics that
are ambiguous: you cannot tell from the term itself which concept is
being referred to, and you need some sort of context (or semantic
hint.) Classification serves this purpose well. In addition,
classification allows entries to be browsed by subject, through a
subject classification hierarchy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">For classification, currently PlanetMath only supports MSC, the AMS
Mathematical Subject Classification scheme. MSC is very widely used
and is more or less exhaustive over known mathematics – you probably
will never run into an entry that can’t be classified with MSC (at
least to one level in the hierarchy.)</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The MSC takes some getting used to. In order to make things easier, we
have set up a <a href="http://aux.planetmath.org/msc" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_href">local copy</a>
of the MSC which is hierarchically browseable and searchable, which
is accessible from the menu.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">The entries in italics are meant to be attached to other entries. They
do not show up in the encyclopedia index, so placing an entry under
one of these categories has important practical as well as
philosophical ramifications.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">An example of why types matter: a definition should not have proof,
since definitions have no truth value – but it may have a
derivation. Hence, you cannot attach a proof to a definition
(actually, you can, but it is discouraged.)</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">A theorem may have a proof, and in fact it should be provided for a
full acceptance of the theorem as a theorem. Hence, PlanetMath makes
it easy for a proof to be attached to a theorem (and only a theorem.)
As before, you actually can attach a theorem to anything, but doing so
is less convenient and is discouraged.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Examples are meant to be used everywhere. They allow some of the load

<div id="S2.SS3.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The “Conjecture” type might be a little confusing to some. In terms
of how the system treats conjectures, they are the same as
theorems. That is, they are meant to have proofs attached to them, as
well as results or corollaries. This makes sense, since a conjecture
is basically treated as a yet-unproven theorem. However, when one
looks at a topic like the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture (which has now
been proven), its hard to decide which type is more
appropriate. Proven conjectures may still be better left as
conjectures by convention. The opposite situation is a conjecture
which is considered a theorem before its time – like Fermat’s last
theorem. Yet another situation might occur when it turns out a
conjecture (like the Continuum Hypothesis) is unprovable (can only be
used as an axiom). There is no single answer for these situations, you
simply must take into account practical considerations (for instance,
that conjectures won’t show up in “unproven theorems”) and
convention on a case-by-case basis. Don’t worry too much, however,
about picking the absolute best type the first time around in such an
ambiguous situation.</p>

copyright protection has nothing to do with whether the work is
published or unpublished, whether a work is still in print, or
whether the publisher charges for copies of the work. In fact, the
simple act of writing something down automatically confers copyright
protection to the author. In particular, this means that class
notes and handouts, webpages, and newsgroup postings are all legally
protected.</p>

were handed out in a class, or even notes that you took on a spoken
lecture, without first obtaining written permission. Asking for
permission is also an opportunity to tell others about PlanetMath

works that are in the public domain are mostly those whose
copyrights have expired, but also works that have been transfered to
the public domain by their authors, as well publications of the US
government. As a rule of thumb, works published in the ninteteenth
century and earlier are in the public domain, but unless you can
find proof to the contrary, twentieth century works are likely to be
off-limits. It is of course wise to give a citation so that others
can easily check the assignment (or expiry) of copyright for
themselves – and perhaps also find additional useful material from
the same source.

mind: (a) The law on when copyright expires is somewhat different
for unpublished works, so these need to be treated as a special
case; (b) Before World War II, English was not the dominant language
of the mathematical community. Therefore, older works are more
likely than contemporary works to appear in a language other than
English. Since translation is a creative act, translations are
protected by copyright, even if the work that was translated is in
the public domain. Thus, if you quote at length from an older work
written in a foreign language, you should either do the translation
yourself, or else find a translation which is also in the public
domain (or FDL’ed).</span></span></span>

qualified to write an entry about that topic. Not only is this
policy prudent from the legal standpoint, it also makes sense from the
point of view of mathematical content. If you rely too heavily on a
given source, you run the risk of perpetuating whatever mistakes and
oversights may be present there. Furthermore, unless you have a
fairly deep understanding of a given topic, you might misunderstand
another author’s use of a particular technical term, or forget to
state assumptions which this other author stated in an earlier
chapter. A document written from your own understanding will be much
more useful than one that purports to present facts that you
yourself do not understand. You needn’t be a world expert to write
a useful entry – simply trying to state your own questions clearly

you to try to mimic someone else’s exposition.</p>
