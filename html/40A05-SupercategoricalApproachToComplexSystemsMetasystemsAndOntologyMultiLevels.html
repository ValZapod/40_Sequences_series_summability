“The culmination of the new approach to logic lay in its capacity to illuminate the nature of the mathematical reasoning.

<div id="S0.SS1.SSS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">A novel approach to QST construction in Algebraic/Axiomatic QFT involves the use
of generalized fundamental theorems of algebraic topology from
specialized, ‘globally well-behaved’ topological spaces, to
arbitrary ones (Baianu et al, 2007c). In this category, are the generalized, <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Higher
Homotopy van Kampen theorems (HHvKT)</em> of Algebraic Topology with
novel and unique non-Abelian applications. Such theorems greatly aid
the calculation of higher homotopy of topological spaces. R. Brown and coworkers (1999, 2004a,b,c) generalized the van Kampen theorem, at first to fundamental groupoids on a set of base points (Brown,1967), and then, to higher dimensional algebras involving, for example,
homotopy double groupoids and 2-categories (Brown, 2004a). The more sensitive <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">algebraic invariant</em> of topological spaces seems to be, however, captured only by <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">cohomology</em> theory through an algebraic <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">ring</em> structure that is not accessible either in
homology theory, or in the existing homotopy theory. Thus, two arbitrary topological spaces that have isomorphic homology groups may not have isomorphic cohomological ring structures, and may also
not be homeomorphic, even if they are of the same homotopy type.
Furthermore, several <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">non-Abelian</em> results in algebraic topology could only be derived from the Generalized van Kampen Theorem (cf. Brown, 2004a), so that
one may find links of such results to the expected <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">‘non-commutative</em> geometrical’ structure of quantized space–time
(Connes, 1994). In this context, the important algebraic–topological concept of a <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Fundamental Homotopy Groupoid (FHG) is applied to a Quantum Topological Space (QTS)</em> as a “partial classifier” of the <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">invariant</em> topological properties
of quantum spaces of <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">any</em> dimension; quantum topological
spaces are then linked together in a <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">crossed complex over a
quantum groupoid</em> (Baianu, Brown and Glazebrook, 2006), thus
suggesting the construction of global topological structures from
local ones with well-defined quantum homotopy groupoids. The latter
theme is then further pursued through defining locally topological
groupoids that can be globally characterized by applying the
Globalization Theorem, which involves the <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">unique</em> construction
of the Holonomy Groupoid. We are considering in a separate publication(Baianu et al 2007c) how such concepts might be applied in the context of Algebraic or Axiomatic Quantum
Field Theory (AQFT) to provide a local-to-global construction of Quantum space-times which would still be valid in the presence of intense gravitational fields without generating singularities as in GR. The result of such a construction is a <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Quantum Holonomy Groupoid</em>, (QHG) which is unique up to an isomorphism.</p>

<div id="S0.SS1.SSS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In classifications, such as those developed over time in Biology
for organisms, or in Chemistry for chemical elements, the
<em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">objects</em> are the basic items being classified even if the
‘ultimate’ goal may be, for example, either evolutionary or
mechanistic studies. Rutherford’s comment is pertinent in this
context: <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">“There are two major types of science: physics or stamp collecting.” </em>
An ontology based strictly on object classification may have
little to offer from the point of view of its cognitive content.
It is interesting that many psychologists, especially behavioural
ones, emphasize the object-based approach rather than the
process-based approach to the ultra-complex process of
consciousness occurring ‘in the mind’ –with the latter thought as
an ‘object’. Nevertheless, as early as the work of William James
in 1850, consciousness was considered as a <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">‘continuous
stream that never repeats itself</em>’–a Heraclitian concept that
does also apply to super-complex systems and life, in general. We
shall see more examples of the object-based approach to psychology

<p class="ltx_p">the categorical closure (or completeness) of levels.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="ltx_p">Already we can underscore a significant component of this essay
that relates the ontology to geometry and topology; specifically, if a
level is defined <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">via</em> ‘iterates of local procedures’ (viz. ‘items in
iteration’, Poli, 2001), then we have some handle on describing
its intrinsic governing dynamics (with feedback ) and, to quote
Poli (2001), to ‘restrict the <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">multi-dynamic</em> frames to their linear
fragments’. On each level of this ontological hierarchy there is a significant
amount of connectivity through inter-dependence, interactions or
general relations often giving rise to complex patterns that are
not readily analyzed by partitioning or through stochastic methods
as they are neither simple, nor are they random connections. But we
claim that such complex patterns and processes have their
logico-categorical representations quite apart from classical,
Boolean mechanisms. This ontological situation gives rise to a
wide variety of networks, graphs, and/or mathematical categories,
all with different connectivity rules, different types of
activities, and also <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">a hierarchy of super-networks of networks of sub-networks</em>.
Then, the important question arises what types of
basic symmetry or patterns such super-networks of items can have,
and also how do the effects of their sub-networks ‘percolate’ through the
various levels. From the categorical viewpoint, these are of two
basic types: they are either <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">commutative</em> or <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">non-commutative</em>,
where, at least at the quantum level, the latter takes precedence over the former.</p>
</div>
<div id="S0.SS1.SSS4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">It is often thought or taken for granted that the <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">object-oriented</em> approach can be readily converted into a process-based one. It would seem, however, that the answer to this question depends critically on the ontological level selected. For example, at the quantum level, <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">object and process become inter-mingled</em>. Either comparing or moving between
levels, requires ultimately a <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">process-based</em> approach, especially
in Categorical Ontology where relations and inter-process
connections are essential to developing any valid theory. At the
fundamental level of ‘elementary particle physics’ however the
answer to this question of process-vs. object becomes quite
difficult as a result of the ‘blurring’ between the particle and
the wave concepts. Thus, it is well-known that any ‘elementary
quantum object’ is considered by all accepted versions of quantum
theory not just as a ‘particle’ or just a ‘wave’ but both: the
quantum ‘object’ is <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">both</em> wave and particle, <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">at the
same-time</em>, a proposition accepted since the time when it was
proposed by de Broglie. At the quantum microscopic level, the
object and process are inter-mingled, they are no longer separate
items. Therefore, in the quantum view the ‘object-particle’ and
the dynamic process-‘wave’ are united into a single dynamic entity
or item, called <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">the wave-particle quantum</em>, which strangely enough
is <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">neither discrete nor continuous</em>, but both at the same time, thus
‘refusing’ intrinsically to be an item consistent with Boolean
logic. Ontologically, the quantum level is a fundamentally important
starting point which needs to be taken into account by any theory
of levels that aims at completeness. Such completeness may not be
attainable, however, simply because an ‘extension’ of Gödel’s theorem may
hold here also. The fundamental quantum level is generally accepted to be
dynamically, or intrinsically <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">non-commutative</em>, in the sense
of the<em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic"> non-commutative quantum logic</em> and also in the sense of
<em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">non-commuting quantum operators</em> for the essential quantum
observables such as position and momentum. Therefore, any comprehensive theory of levels, in the sense of incorporating the quantum level, is thus –<em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">mutatis
mutandis</em>– <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">non-Abelian</em>. Furthermore, as the non-Abelian case is the more general one, from a strictly formal viewpoint, a non-Abelian Categorical Ontology is
the preferred choice. A paradigm-shift towards a <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">non-Abelian Categorical Ontology</em> has already started (Brown et al, 2007: <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">‘Non-Abelian Algebraic Topology’</em>; Baianu, Brown and Glazebrook, 2006: NA-QAT; Baianu et al 2007a,b,c).

<div id="S0.SS1.SSS5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">We shall consider briefly the potential impact of novel Algebraic Topology concepts, methods and results on the problems of defining and classifying rigorously Quantum space-times. With the advent of Quantum Groupoids–generalizing Quantum Groups, Quantum Algebra and Quantum Algebraic Topology, several fundamental concepts and new theorems of Algebraic Topology may also acquire an enhanced importance through their potential applications to current problems in theoretical
and mathematical physics, such as those described in an available preprint (Baianu, Brown and Glazebrook, 2006), and also in several recent publications (Baianu et al 2007a,b; Brown et al 2007).</p>

<p class="ltx_p">Now, if quantum mechanics is to reject the notion of a continuum,
then it must also reject the notion of the real line and the notion
of a path. How then is one to construct a homotopy theory?
One possibility is to take the route signalled by Čech, and which
later developed in the hands of Borsuk into ‘Shape Theory’ (see,
Cordier and Porter, 1989). Thus a quite general space is studied by
means of its approximation by open covers. Yet another possible
approach is briefly pointed out in <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">AN-2.6</span>. A few fundamental concepts of Algebraic Topology and Category Theory are summarized in <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">AN-2.6</span> that have an extremely wide range of applicability to the higher complexity levels of reality as well as to the fundamental, quantum level(s). We have omitted in this section the technical details in order to focus only on the ontologically-relevant aspects; full mathematical details are however also available in a recent paper by Brown et al (2007) that focuses on a mathematical/conceptual framework for a completely formal approach to categorical ontology and the theory of levels.</p>

<div id="S0.SS1.SSS6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Often, Rashevsky considered in his Relational Biology papers, and
indeed made comparisons, between established physical theories and principles. He was searching for new, more general relations in Biology and Sociology that were also compatible with the former. Furthermore, Rashevsky also proposed two biological principles that add to
Darwin’s natural selection of species and the ‘survival of the fittest principle’, <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">the emergent
relational structure thus defining adaptive organisms</em>:</p>

</div>
<div id="S0.SS1.SSS6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In essence, the ‘Principle of Optimal Design’ defines the ‘fittest’ organism which survives in the natural selection process of competition between species, in terms of an extremal
criterion, similar to that of Maupertuis; the optimally ‘designed’
organism is that which acquires maximum functionality essential to
survival of the successful species at the lowest ‘cost’ possible.
The ‘costs’ are defined in the context of the environmental niche
in terms of material, energy, genetic and organismic processes
required to produce/entail the pre-requisite biological function(s) and
their supporting anatomical structure(s) needed for competitive survival
in the selected niche. Further details were presented by Robert
Rosen in his short but significant book on optimality (1970). The ‘Principle of
Biological Epimorphism’ on the other hand states that the highly specialized
biological functions of higher organisms can be mapped (through an epimorphism) onto those
of the simpler organisms, and ultimately onto those of a (hypothetical) primordial organism (which was assumed to be unique up to an isomorphism or <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">selection-equivalence</em>). The latter proposition, as formulated by Rashevsky, is more akin to a postulate
than a principle. However, it was then generalized and re-stated in the form of the
existence of a <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">limit</em> in the category of living organisms and their
functional genetic networks (<math id="S0.SS1.SSS6.p3.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\textbf{GN}^{i}" display="inline"><msup><mtext>𝐆𝐍</mtext><mi>i</mi></msup></math>), as a directed family of

subsequently as a super-limit (Baianu, 1970 to 1987; Baianu, Brown, Georgescu and Glazebrook, 2006); then, it was re-phrased as the <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Postulate of Relational Invariance</em>, represented by a <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">colimit</em> with the arrow of time pointing forward (Baianu, Brown, Georgescu and
Glazebrook, 2006). Somewhat similarly, a dual principle and colimit construction was invoked
for the ontogenetic development of organisms (Baianu, 1970), and also for
populations evolving forward in time; this was subsequently applied to biological evolution although on a much longer time scale –that of evolution– also with the arrow of time pointing towards the future in a representation operating through Memory Evolutive Systems (MES) by A. Ehresmann and Vanbremeersch (2006).

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsubsection">0.1.7. </span>Selective Boundaries and Homeostasis. Varying Boundaries <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">vs</em> Horizons.</h3>

<div id="S0.SS1.SSS7.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Boundaries are especially relevant to <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">closed</em> systems.
According to Poli (2008): <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">“they serve to distinguish what is internal to the system from what is external to it”</em>, thus defining the fixed, overall structural topology
of a <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">closed</em> system. By virtue of possessing boundaries, a whole (entity) is something on the basis of which there is an interior and an exterior (<em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">viz.</em> Baianu and Poli, 2007).
One notes however that a boundary, or boundaries, may either change/<em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">vary</em> or be quite
<em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">selective</em>/directional–in the sense of <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">dynamic fluxes crossing such boundaries</em>–
if the system is <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">open</em>. In the case of an organism that grows and develops it will be therefore characterized by a <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">variable topology</em> that may also depend on the environment, and is thus <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">context-dependent</em>, as well. Perhaps one of the simplest example of a system that changes from <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">closed to open</em>, and thus has a <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">variable topology</em>, is that of a pipe equipped with a functional valve that allows flow in only one direction. On the other hand,
a semi-permeable membrane such as a cellophane, thin-walled ’closed’ tube–
that allows water and small molecule fluxes to go through but blocks the transport
of large molecules such as polymers through its pores– is <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">selective</em>
and may be considered as a primitive/’simple’ example of an open,
selective system. Organisms, in general, are <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">open systems with specific types or patterns of variable topology</em> which incorporate both the valve and the selectively permeable membrane
boundaries –albeit much more sophisticated and dynamic than the simple/fixed topology of the cellophane membrane; such variable structures are essential to maintaining
their stability and also to the control of their internal structural order, of low microscopic entropy. (The formal definition of this important concept of ‘variable topology’
was introduced in our recent paper (Baianu et al 2007a) in the context of the space-time evolution of organisms, populations and species.)</p>
</div>
<div id="S0.SS1.SSS7.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">As proposed by Baianu and Poli (2008), an essential feature of boundaries in open systems is that they can be crossed by matter; however, all boundaries may be crossed by either fields
or by quantum wave-particles if the boundaries are sufficiently thin, even in ’closed’ systems. The boundaries of closed systems, however, cannot be crossed by molecules or larger particles. <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">On the contrary, a horizon is something that one cannot reach.</em> In other words, <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">a horizon is not a boundary</em>. This difference between horizon and boundary appears to be useful in distinguishing between systems and their environment (v. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">AN-4.1</span>). Boundaries may be fixed, clear-cut, or they may be vague/blurred, mobile, varying/variable in time, or again they may be intermediate between these any of these cases, according to how the differentiation is structured. At the beginning of an organism’s ontogenetic development, there may be only a slightly asymmetric distribution in perhaps just one direction, but usually still maintaining certain symmetries along other directions or planes. Interestingly, for many multi-cellular organisms, including man, the overall symmetry retained from the beginning of ontogenetic development is bilateral–just one plane of mirror symmetry– from Planaria to humans.

<p class="ltx_p">Brown and Higgins, 1981a, showed that certain multiple groupoids
equipped with an extra structure called <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">connections</em> were
equivalent to another structure called a <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">crossed complex</em>
which had already occurred in homotopy theory. such as
<em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">double, or multiple</em> groupoids (Brown, 2004; 2005).
For example, the notion of an <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">atlas</em> of structures should,
in principle, apply to a lot of interesting, topological and/or
algebraic, structures: groupoids, multiple groupoids, Heyting
algebras, <math id="S0.SS1.SSS7.p4.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="n" display="inline"><mi>n</mi></math>-valued logic algebras and <math id="S0.SS1.SSS7.p4.m2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="C^{*}" display="inline"><msup><mi>C</mi><mo>*</mo></msup></math>-convolution
-algebras. One might incorporate a 3 or 4-valued logic to represent
genetic dynamic networks in single-cell organisms such as bacteria. Another
example from the ultra-complex system of the human mind is <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">synaesthesia</em>–the case of
extreme communication processes between different types of
‘logics’ or different levels of ‘thoughts’/thought processes. The
key point here is <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">communication</em>. Hearing has to communicate
to sight/vision in some way; this seems to happen in the human
brain in the audiovisual (neocortex) and in the Wernicke (W)
integrating area in the left-side hemisphere of the brain, that
also communicates with the speech centers or the Broca area, also
in the left hemisphere. Because of this <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">dual-functional</em>,
quasi-symmetry, or more precisely asymmetry of the human brain, it
may be useful to represent all two-way communication/signalling
pathways in the two brain hemispheres by a <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">double groupoid</em>
as an over-simplified groupoid structure that may represent such
quasi-symmetry of the two sides of the human brain. In this case,
the 300 millions or so of neuronal interconnections in the
<em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">corpus callosum</em> that link up neural network pathways
between the left and the right hemispheres of the brain would be
represented by the geometrical connection in the double groupoid.
The brain’s overall <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">asymmetric</em> distribution of functions
and neural network structure between the two brain hemispheres may
therefore require a non-commutative, double–groupoid structure
for its relational representation. The potentially interesting
question then arises how one would mathematically represent the
split-brains that have been neurosurgically generated by cutting
just the <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">corpus callosum</em>– some 300 million
interconnections in the human brain (Sperry, 1992). It would seem
that either a crossed complex of two, or several, groupoids, or
indeed a direct product of two groupoids <math id="S0.SS1.SSS7.p4.m3" class="ltx_Math" alttext="G_{1}" display="inline"><msub><mi>G</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math> and <math id="S0.SS1.SSS7.p4.m4" class="ltx_Math" alttext="G_{2}" display="inline"><msub><mi>G</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></math>, <math id="S0.SS1.SSS7.p4.m5" class="ltx_Math" alttext="G_{1}\times G_{2}" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>G</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>×</mo><msub><mi>G</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></math> might provide some of the simplest representations of
the human split-brain. The latter, direct product construction has
a certain kind of built-in commutativity: <math id="S0.SS1.SSS7.p4.m6" class="ltx_Math" alttext="(a,b)(c,d)=(ac,bd)" display="inline"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>b</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mo>⁢</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>c</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>d</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>c</mi></mrow><mo>,</mo><mrow><mi>b</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>d</mi></mrow><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>,
which is a form of the interchange law. In fact, from any two
groupoids <math id="S0.SS1.SSS7.p4.m7" class="ltx_Math" alttext="G_{1}" display="inline"><msub><mi>G</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math> and <math id="S0.SS1.SSS7.p4.m8" class="ltx_Math" alttext="G_{2}" display="inline"><msub><mi>G</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></math> one can construct a double groupoid <math id="S0.SS1.SSS7.p4.m9" class="ltx_Math" alttext="G_{1}\Join G_{2}" display="inline"><mrow><msub><mi>G</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>⨝</mo><msub><mi>G</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></math> whose objects are <math id="S0.SS1.SSS7.p4.m10" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\operatorname{Ob}(G_{1})\times\operatorname{Ob}(G_{2})" display="inline"><mrow><mrow><mi>Ob</mi><mo>⁡</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>G</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>×</mo><mrow><mi>Ob</mi><mo>⁡</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>G</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>. The
internal groupoid ‘connection’ present in the double groupoid
would then represent the remaining basal/‘ancient’ brain
connections between the two hemispheres, below the corpum callosum
that has been removed by neurosurgery in the split-brain human
patients.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">The remarkable variability observed in such human subjects both
between different subjects and also at different times after the
split-brain (bridge-localized) surgery may very well be accounted
for by the different possible groupoid representations. It may
also be explained by the existence of other, older neural pathways
that remain untouched by the neurosurgeon in the split-brain, and
which re-learn gradually, in time, to at least partially
re-connect the two sides of the human split-brain. The more common
health problem –caused by the senescence of the brain– could be
approached as a <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">local-to-global</em>, super-complex ageing
process represented for example by the <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">patching</em> of a
<em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">topological double groupoid atlas</em> connecting up many local
faulty dynamics in ‘small’ un–repairable regions of the brain
neural network, caused for example by tangles, locally blocked
arterioles and/or capillaries, and also low local oxygen or
nutrient concentrations. The result, as correctly surmised by
Rosen (1987), is a <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">global</em>, rather than local, senescence,
super-complex dynamic process.</p>

Within a social system the autopoiesis of the various components is a necessary
and sufficient condition for realization of the system itself. In
this respect, the structure of a society as a particular instance
of a social system is determined by the structural framework of
the (autopoietic components) and the sum total of collective
interactive relations. Consequently, the societal framework is
based upon a selection of its component structures in providing a
medium in which these components realize their ontogeny. It is
just through participation alone that an autopoietic system
determines a social system by realizing the relations that are
characteristic of that system. The descriptive and causal notions

<p class="ltx_p">The autopoietic model of Maturana (1987) claims to explain the
persistence of living systems in time as the consequence of their
structural coupling or <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">adaptation</em> as structure determined
systems, and also because of their existence as <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">molecular</em>
autopoietic systems with a ‘closed’ network structure. As part of
the autopoietic explanation is the ‘structural drift’, presumably
facilitating evolutionary changes and speciation. One notes that
autopoietic systems may be therefore considered as dynamic
realizations of Rosen’s simple <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">MR</span> s. Similar arguments seem to be
echoed more recently by Dawkins (2003) who claims to explain the
remarkable persistence of biological organisms over geological

adaptive capabilities.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">The point is being often made that it is not the component atoms

<div id="S0.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">This was the feature that appeared paradoxical or puzzling to
Erwin Schrödinger from a quantum theoretical point of view when
he wrote his book “What is Life?” As individual molecules often
interact through multiple quantum interactions, which are most of
the time causing <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">irreversible</em>, molecular or energetic
changes to occur, how can one then explain the hereditary
stability over hundreds of years (<em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">or occasionally, a great
deal longer, NAs</em>) within the same genealogy of a family of men?
The answer is that the ‘actors change but the play does not!’. The
atoms and molecules turn-over, and not infrequently, but the
<em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">structure-function patterns/organismic categories remain
unchanged</em>/are conserved over long periods of time through
repeated repairs and replacements of the molecular parts that need
repairing, as long as the organism lives. Such stable patterns of
relations are, at least in principle, amenable to logical and
mathematical representation without tearing apart the living
system. In fact, looking at this remarkable persistence of certain
gene subnetworks in time and space from the categorical ontology
and Darwinian viewpoints, the <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">existence of live ‘fossils’</em>
(e.g., a coelacanth found alive in 1923 to have remained unchanged
at great depths in the ocean as a species for 300 million years!)
it is not so difficult to explain; one can attribute the rare
examples of ‘live fossils’ to the lack of ‘selection pressure in a
very stable niche’. Thus, one sees in such exceptions the lack of
any adaptation apart from those which have already occurred some
300 million years ago. This is by no means the only long lived
species: several species of marine, giant unicellular green algae
with complex morphology from a family called the
<em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Dasycladales</em> may have persisted as long as 600 million
years (Goodwin, 1994), and so on. However, the situation of many
other species that emerged through <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">super-complex
adaptations</em>–such as the species of <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Homo sapiens</em>–is quite
the opposite, in the sense of marked, super-complex adaptive
changes over much shorter time–scales than that of the
exceptionally ‘lucky’ coelacanths. Clearly, some species, that
were less adaptable, such as the Neanderthals or <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Homo
erectus</em>, became extinct even though many of their functional
genes may be still conserved in <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Homo sapiens</em>, as for
example, through comparison with the more distant chimpanzee
relative. When comparing the <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Homo erectus</em> fossils with
skeletal remains of modern men one is struck how much closer the
former are to modern man than to either the
<em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Australopithecus</em> or the chimpanzee (the last two species
appear to have quite similar skeletons and skulls, and also their
‘reconstructed’ vocal chords/apparatus would not allow them to
speak). Therefore, if the functional genomes of man and chimpanzee
overlap by about <math id="S0.SS2.p3.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="98\%" display="inline"><mrow><mn>98</mn><mo lspace="0pt" rspace="3.5pt">%</mo></mrow></math>, then the overlap of modern man
functional genome would have to be greater than <math id="S0.SS2.p3.m2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="99\%" display="inline"><mrow><mn>99</mn><mo lspace="0pt" rspace="3.5pt">%</mo></mrow></math> with that
of <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Homo erectus</em> of 1 million years ago, if it somehow could
be actually found and measured (but it cannot be, at least not at
this point in time). Thus, one would also wonder if another more
recent hominin than <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">H. erectus</em>, such as <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Homo
floresiensis</em>– which is estimated to have existed between 74,000
and 18,000 years ago on the now Indonesian island of Flores– may
have been capable of human speech. One may thus consider another
indicator of intelligence such as the size of region 10 of the
dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, which is thought to be associated
with the existence of <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">self-awareness</em>; this region 10 is
about the same size in <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">H. floresiensis</em> as in modern humans,
despite the much smaller overall size of the brain in the former

<p class="ltx_p">Categorical representations on nerve cells in the terminology of Ehresmann
and Vanbremeersch (1987,2006) are called ‘categorical neurons’ (or
<em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">cat–neurons</em> for short). ‘Consciousness loops’ (Edelmann
1989, 1992) and the neuronal workspace of Baars (1988) (see also
Baars and Franklin, 2003) are among an assortment of such local models that
may be consistent with such local categorical representations. Among other notions, there
were proposed several criteria for studying the overall integration of neuronal assemblies
into an <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">archetypal core</em>: the cat–neuron resonates as an
echo that propagates to target concepts through series of
thalamocortical loops in response to the thalamus response to stimuli.
Mimicking the neuron signalling through synaptic networks, cat–neurons would interact
according tp certain linking procedures (Baianu, 1972), that could be then studied in the context of
categorical logic, which in its turn may be applied either to semantic
modelling of neural networks (Healy and Caudell, 2006) or possibly the schemata of <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">adaptive resonance theory</em> of Grossberg (1999). For such interactive network systems one would expect
<em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">global actions</em> and <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">groupoid atlases</em> to play more instrumental roles as possible realizations of various types of multi–agent systems (Bak et al, 2006). Let one be
